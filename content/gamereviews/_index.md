One of the things I do for more than a decade, is gaming and I still love about every aspects of it. I have difficulties to find games that seems attractive to me and I personally do not like spending time to read long reviews or watch videos to get spoilers before even I play the game itself. Here, I will share my perspective about the games I tried and I will give them a short review and rate them so that people that has similar taste can use this list to find something to play.

I might also share topics or my ideas related to Game Theory. This topic is not just related to games, it actually applies to most of the sectors in our lives.

Feel free to share your ideas with me and suggest games for me to check it out and review as well :)
