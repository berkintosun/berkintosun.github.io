I have been reading content shared by other professionals for years and I have observed the different strategies they use to create their content. I like to take personal notes as it helps me to nourish my knowledge and I simplify most of the parts by removing fancy words. I consider fancy words as those that bring confusion rather than value to the reader. I have been thinking of sharing my point of view with the online community, but I always postponed it. However, for the past couple of years, I have been helping interns and new grads to improve their knowledge about this field, and I noticed that the notes I created were very helpful to them. Using my learning methodology, they could understand the concepts instead of pseudo-understanding. I realized that the fear of learning something new suppresses our urge to point out the parts that we do not fully understand, and when fancy words come up, we lose our focus and start memorizing instead of learning the theorem itself. This creates a false feeling of knowing the topic as we don't dig deeper due to the urge.

The internet is vast and hard to navigate as new information is added every second. Although we use social media and search engines, finding this kind of information is becoming increasingly difficult. Currently, my wife is transitioning her career into software development, and I am supporting her every step of the way. I believe that my way of learning can help people, especially my amazingly beautiful wife. Therefore, I am starting a blog to share my perspective, which will be helpful to her and anyone who takes the time to read it. It will also help me a lot because if I cannot simplify a topic, it means I do not fully understand it. As the quote goes, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."

My plans for this blog will include my hobbies, such as gaming, my projects, and my opinions. I would appreciate comments and feedback from my readers as my purpose is to help others who have a passion for computer science and software development. The joy of helping someone find their next job or enabling them to bring their ideas to reality brings me joy, and I hope to have a positive impact on your lives, even if it is slight.

Lastly, I want my amazing wife to know that I love her so much, and that I am grateful to have her in my life. She brings out the best in me, and I am thankful for her.
