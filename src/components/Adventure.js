          <h5>2015-2016</h5>
          <p>During my studies at Yaşar University, my curiosity and thirst for the knowledge must have get the attention of my teachers and they invited me to take a test for the assistant position.

          <h4>Software Engineer Intern</h4>
          <h5>Fall 2017</h5>
          <p>During this time, my curiosity about web development peaked at that time and I went to Sole just to learn the current state of web development.

          <h3>Univerlist</h3>
          <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
          <h5>Jan 2017 - Jan 2018</h5>
          <p>Univerlist was my first startup experience and I assure you, that was an intense experience... I had to work on so many different fields and had to learn so much new stuff.
            This startup was harsh reality of the actual work-life and this intensive requirements allowed me to reach my best performance and showed me that I can do so many things that I would believe that I couldn't.
          </p>
          <p>We developed a university search engine with lots of detailed information about each university in Turkey. I write dozens of web crawlers that updates the information about each university on hundreds of different sources.
            Also, I developed a special socring algorithm to be able to score universities by using lots of non-biased sources in order to reduce the subjectivity in the scoring system. As this was a startup company, I had to work on Frontend and IOS development as well.
            This position allowed me to develop myself at a very fast learning pace and I am glad to see that I can handle this kind of pressure in my working life.

          <h3>Yaşar University</h3>
          <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
          <h5>Oct 2017 - Feb 2018</h5>
          <p>While I work at Univerlist, I wanted to learn Mac environment and I needed an extra cash to buy a Mac just to be able to learn it.
            In the mean time, Yaşar university opened a part-time position on their IT department and as soon as I see the opportunity, I jumped on it!
            This job allowed me to experience a corporate work and that was totally different than usual startup workflow. I had to get an approval for every update and my permission to update/change the actual product, was limited.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, I had the chance of working with an awesome director Gökhan Panayır, who is a very sweet person also a very passionate one!
             We developed a private authentication system for internal usage and a face recognition system for the security. We also worked on Frontend of the dashboard and studied the user experience to improve our user interface.

          <h5>Jun 2019 - Sep 2019</h5>
          <p>As I learn more about the business side of the software development, I wanted to practice it by applying it to an actual case.

             Also, created a business application with React Native for internal usage. It provides a statistical information about the performance of each individual employee and individual sale performance of each department.
             I used NodeJS and MongoDB to allow their frontend team to work on backend side as well so that they can continue to develop the needed features.

          <h5> Since March 2020</h5>
          <p>There was an event called 'Delta Career Day' and in this event, I checked countless companies and get in touch with them but there was one specific company that got my interest.
             You guessed it right! It was Playtech that got my interest because they bring a game device which uses computer vision to bring the tower defense into a physical form. When I asked about it, they just said that it was a fun project made by Playtech team.
             After I heard that, I applied for this position :)

          <p>When I joined, company changed its working style because of coronavirus and I missed so many trainings about the internal systems and product of Playtech but still I manage to adapt to it from remotely and this improved my work style flexibility.
             I am currently working in Automation team and we are automizing the testings for the Playtech products. I have a wonderful team and they helped me every time when I had questions.
